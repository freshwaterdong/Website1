		Hello.
	</h1>
	<p>
		It seems that we have stumbled here together, on the internet, as our medium of all interactions between us. Those said interactions will mostly be static, hopefully the interaction itself be dynamic. 



		I don't know what you want to hear, or for the matter don't want to hear, so I shall just write what pops into my head. In it's naive honesty, and perhaps with vigor and passion. So, if you are easily offended, this will serve as a warning statement. A testament to the honesty of our conversation, where the only facade you see is the only one you expect.

		This is raw, primal, and the essence of <a href="intro_personal.html">Dong</a>.
