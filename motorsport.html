		Motor sport: an affair to remember
	</h3>

	<p>
		Life as we know it may be different if motorized transportation didn't materialize. It has brought communities closer and encouraged leaving our nest as we knew we can always make it back. It also brought out passion where daring feats were made on the track and off the track.
	</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		So, let's start with what my opinion on what motor sport is. I don't think I can simply pick a word or a phrase that can describe the sensations I feel when I think of motor sport. A lot of love, but equal amounts of passionate, ignorant hatred just because. So, here's a quickie for the logic...
		<br>
		<br>
		Cars should be driven, breathing the life into the mechanical monsters, no matter how small or slow. Driven with the vigor of being chased by joy.
		<br>
		<br>
		Station wagons should be owned by every driver or household. It is essentially a great compromise between every type of vehicle out there.
